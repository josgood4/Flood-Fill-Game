# Flood-Fill-Game
Inspired by the /r/dailyprogrammer challenge [2016-12-23] Challenge #296.

Tested in Python 3.5, with tkinter

Run the file `tile game 2 - Reddit 3-9-17.py`

The goal of the game is to get the board to be all the same number.

This can be accomplished by incrementing or decrementing any group of adjacent (excluding diagonals) numbers.

Have fun!

Note: The numbers wrap around from 0 to 9 - this number can be changed by changing the value of `DEFAULT_N_MAX` in BoxClass2.py
